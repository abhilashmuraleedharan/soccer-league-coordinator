# soccer-league-coordinator
Treehouse | iOS Techdegree - Project 1


**Instructions**


You have volunteered to be the coordinator for your town’s youth soccer league. As part of your job you need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams — Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors. In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year you are doing your best to fix that. For each child, you will have the following information:
Name,
Height (in inches),
Whether or not they have played soccer before, and
Their guardians’ names.


The project has three major parts. For each part, choose only from the tools we have covered in the courses so far.

* Native types and collections to store data (Dictionary, Array, Int, String, etc)
* Accessing, appending and counting arrays
* Accessing dictionaries and arrays
* Creating control flow
* Use of comparison operators
* String interpolation
* Use of comments

Please don’t employ more advanced tools we haven’t covered yet, even if they are right for the job. (Yes, that means no classes, structs or filters on Project 1.)

The team practice dates/times are as follows:

* Dragons - March 17, 1pm
* Sharks - March 17, 3pm
* Raptors - March 18, 1pm

When your complete code is run in a playground the letters should be stored in a collection named 'letters'. When the code is run, the letters should be visible in the console.

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

Logic to ensure that each team's average height is within 1.5 inch of the others as well as having each team contain the same number of experienced players. Your logic should be make use of dynamic values like the average height of teams or players and not be based on any magic numbers or hard-coded values. You should not rely on a particular ordering of the initial collection of players - the logic should work regardless of the order of players in the initial collection. (Please note, this feature only needs to meet the 1.5 inch threshold for the given set of players we provided, not for all potential future sets of players.) Please also print out the average height of the players of each team.
